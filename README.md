# ESP32 Wi-Fi Captive Portal 📶🔐

This project creates a Wi-Fi captive portal using an ESP32 microcontroller. It sets up a fake Wi-Fi access point (AP) that prompts users to enter credentials via a login page, mimicking a legitimate network. Captured credentials are stored in the ESP32's EEPROM and can be viewed or cleared through specific endpoints.

## 🚀  Features
- Creates a Wi-Fi access point with a customizable SSID.
- Hosts a responsive login page with Persian and English language support.
- Stores usernames and passwords in EEPROM. 📋
- Provides endpoints to view (`/PassList`) and clear (`/clear`) captured credentials.
- Displays a fake "updating" page after credential submission. ⏳
- Blinks the built-in LED to indicate activity during submission. 💡

- ## 🔧 Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 development board (e.g., ESP32 DevKitC). 🛠️
- USB cable for programming and power. 🔌
- Computer with Arduino IDE or PlatformIO. 💻

- ## 🌐 Endpoints
- `GET /`: Displays the login page.
- `POST /login`: Stores credentials and shows a fake "updating" page.
- `GET /PassList`: Lists all captured credentials.
- `GET /clear`: Clears stored credentials and resets EEPROM.
